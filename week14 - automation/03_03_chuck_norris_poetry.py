"""
Using the Chuck Norris API in combination with the datamuse API
( https://api.chucknorris.io/ - https://www.datamuse.com/api/ )
* Query the chucknorris api for a sentence
* Use the last word of that sentence to send a query to the Datamuse API
  and use the rel_rhy (or rel_nry) query parameter to fetch a word that rhymes
* Repeat a coupe of times and store the sentences and rhyme words
* Synthesize the collected results into an avant-garde poem and post on the forum ;)
